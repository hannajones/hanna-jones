My new home on the web. A basic personal website built using React and Firebase.

Features use of React-Router, Materialize CSS, and a basic vanilla Flux implementation. Built as my first post-bootcamp personal project built as a means of delving deeper into React and paving the way to build more complex, data-driven applications in the future.
